# Hello World!

If you checked out my README, then you already know a little but about me. But just for more practice, here I will tell you a little more :)

I grew up in Ohio, but I now live in Michigan. I hate the snowy winters, but the other half of the year is so beautiful, it's almost worth dealing with all the snow.

I love to go to the lakes and collect rocks to bring home, and I like to check out new parks, beaches, and museums that I haven't been to yet.

In addition to my axolotl, I also have two dogs and two cats!
